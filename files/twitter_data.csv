@sanjaymanjrekar Respectfully disagree. CWC19 was below par from the team's standards. Should have been in finals atleast. Captain is responsible. He has improved but still need to give Rohit a chance atleast in t20. Indian cricket system won't allow that. Want cricket to shine not an individual.

"@adityavnathan @ESPNcricinfo In #CWC19 only 3 players DK,MSD &amp; Rohit Sharma were there in the squad who has played odi(part of playing 11)along S.Ganguly for Indian cricket team"
@htTweets Mumbai connection is quite evident here. Mumbai lobby is pushing Rohits case for white ball captaincy. To be honest Rohit deserves his chance to build the team for T20 World Cup. Virat has messed up CT17 &amp; CWC19 campaign big time. Let him concentrate on Test Championship.
@sanjaymanjrekar Respectfully disagree. CWC19 was below par from the team's standards. Should have been in finals atleast. Captain is responsible. He has improved but still need to give Rohit a chance atleast in t20. Indian cricket system won't allow that. Want cricket to shine not an individual.

"@fixingmuktcrik @mainlycricket @anirudhdbz @BCCI Ipl mein bhi kya hi ukhaad rakha hai Dhoni ne? Sirf stats ache hain. Like #CWC19. 

Usse jyada impactful performance to Jadhav ne di thi. Took chances for the team even at the cost of wicket which IMO is much better than hiding at non strikers and stay not out."
"@mainlycricket @anirudhdbz We took Dhoni for #CWC19 on the basis of his twisted ODI stats. Look where it got us.

Iyer played the anchor role for most of this IPL and hence the mediocre strike rate. He can accelerate if need be. Solid technique he has. It's right to use it for India at his peak."

"Australia had been 122 for eight on day one and had conceded a 90-run first-innings lead, but Steve Smith's twin centuries and Nathan Lyon's six for 49 in England's second innings completed a 251-run win. #cricketnews https://t.co/l8HMooI084"
"So to recap: England's batsmen are vulnerable to off-spin and short, fast bowling. Australia have both of those well-covered.

Steve Smith is vulnerable once he reaches 140.

I'm not sure how much more I'll want to see of this series... #Ashes"

"💯Steve Smith second in a match, what a knock. Game on in the First Ashes Test. Would be a Test for the England Batting once they come out to bat with the wicket turning , Nathon Lyon would be a handful @vijaylokapally"
'You literally can't get him out': Steve Smith elevates his batting to a whole new level https://t.co/4adljzv7BU #Ashes
"Australia breached ""Fortress Edgbaston"" and gave a shut up call to all those rowdy English fans mocking Smith for his follies in the past. What a performance by the former skipper
#Ashes #Australia #England #SteveSmith"
What a great test match it’s been &amp; what a way to start the Ashes. Fancy the Aussies to get it done today. Pattinson and Cummins to attack the stumps with aggression and strike with 3 early ones and then Lyon to go to work &amp; pick up 5 and Siddle / Smith with one each ! 1-0 !!
