"Australia had been 122 for eight on day one and had conceded a 90-run first-innings lead, but Steve Smith's twin centuries and Nathan Lyon's six for 49 in England's second innings completed a 251-run win. #cricketnews https://t.co/l8HMooI084"
"So to recap: England's batsmen are vulnerable to off-spin and short, fast bowling. Australia have both of those well-covered.

Steve Smith is vulnerable once he reaches 140.

I'm not sure how much more I'll want to see of this series... #Ashes"

"💯Steve Smith second in a match, what a knock. Game on in the First Ashes Test. Would be a Test for the England Batting once they come out to bat with the wicket turning , Nathon Lyon would be a handful @vijaylokapally"
'You literally can't get him out': Steve Smith elevates his batting to a whole new level https://t.co/4adljzv7BU #Ashes
"Australia breached ""Fortress Edgbaston"" and gave a shut up call to all those rowdy English fans mocking Smith for his follies in the past. What a performance by the former skipper
#Ashes #Australia #England #SteveSmith"
What a great test match it’s been &amp; what a way to start the Ashes. Fancy the Aussies to get it done today. Pattinson and Cummins to attack the stumps with aggression and strike with 3 early ones and then Lyon to go to work &amp; pick up 5 and Siddle / Smith with one each ! 1-0 !!
